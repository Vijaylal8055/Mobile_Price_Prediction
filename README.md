Scuccessfully Redicted mobile price with 89% accuracy

# Predict Mobile Phone Pricing
ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Data Understanding
Already done. We have:
â€¢	2000 rows Ã— 21 columns
â€¢	Target: price_range (multi-class: 0, 1, 2, 3)
â€¢	Features: numeric + binary (e.g., ram, battery_power, touch_screen, etc.)

ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Perform:
â€¢	Descriptive statistics (df.describe())
â€¢	Value counts for price_range
â€¢	Correlation matrix
â€¢	Histograms and boxplots for feature distributions
â€¢	Pairplots for selected features (like ram, battery_power, px_height, etc.)
ðŸ‘‰ Helps identify outliers, skewed distributions, and top correlated features.
ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Data Preprocessing
3.1. Feature Scaling
Use StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler since many models (like KNN, SVM) are sensitive to scale.
3.2. No Missing Data
Already verified: no missing/null values.
ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Model Selection
Try these models:
â€¢	Random Forest: interpretable, fast, accurate
â€¢	Logistic Regression (multi-class)
â€¢	XGBoost or LightGBM
â€¢	(Optional) Neural Network
Letâ€™s start with Random Forest Classifier.

ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Model Training
ðŸ”¹ Step 6: Model Evaluation and plot with ConfusionMatrix
Metrics to watch:
â€¢	Accuracy
â€¢	Precision / Recall / F1-score for each class (0, 1, 2, 3)
ðŸ”¹ Step 7: Feature Importance
ðŸ‘‰ This helps identify which features most affect the price prediction (typically ram, battery_power, px_width, px_height, etc.)
ðŸ”¹ Step 8: Hyperparameter Tuning (Optional)
Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV on the Random Forest or other models to fine-tune accuracy.
ðŸ”¹ Step 9: Final Model & Save
ðŸ”¹ Step 10: Inference and Create a Flask API
Then Deploy the model in GitHub
